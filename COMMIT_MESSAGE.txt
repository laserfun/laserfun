Refactor TreacyCompressor: standardize units, add engineering API, enhance tests

- Change calc_dispersion() to return ps^n units (ps², ps³, ps⁴) instead of SI
- Add calc_dispersion_D() method for engineering units (D in ps/nm, S in ps/nm²)
- Enhance test_compressor_phase_consistency with FOD and full profile comparison
- Add grating_compressor_expansion.py example showing Taylor expansion convergence
- Add pulse_dispersion.py example demonstrating D and S effects on pulses
- Update grating_compressor.py with automatic Littrow angle and improved visualization
- Tighten test tolerances: 0.1% mean error, 1% point-by-point error

All tests passing with measured errors well below thresholds (0.012% mean, 0.064% max).
