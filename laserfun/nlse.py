    """Propagate an laser pulse through a fiber according to the NLSE.

    This function propagates an optical input field (often a laser pulse)
    through a nonlinear material using the generalized nonlinear
    Schrodinger equation, which takes into account dispersion and
    nonlinearity. It is a "one dimensional" calculation, in that it doesn't
    capture things like self focusing and other geometric effects. It's most
    appropriate for analyzing light propagating through optical fibers.

    This code is based on the Matlab code found at www.scgbook.info,
    which is based on Eqs. (3.13), (3.16) and (3.17) of the book
    "Supercontinuum Generation in Optical Fibers" Edited by J. M. Dudley and
    J. R. Taylor (Cambridge 2010). The original Matlab code was written by
    J.C. Travers, M.H. Frosz and J.M. Dudley (2009). They ask that you cite
    the book in publications using their code.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pulse : pulse object
        This is the input pulse.
    fiber : fiber object
        This defines the media ("fiber") through which the pulse propagates.
    nsaves : int
        The number of equidistant grid points along the fiber to return
        the field. Note that the integrator usually takes finer steps than
        this, the nsaves parameters simply determines what is returned by this
        function.
    atol : float
        Absolute tolerance for the integrator. Smaller values produce more
        accurate results but require longer integration times.
    rtol : float
        Relative tolerance for the integrator.
    reload_fiber : boolean
        This determines if the fiber information is reloaded at each step. This
        should be set to True if the fiber properties (gamma, dispersion) vary
        as a function of length.
    raman : boolean
        Determines if the Raman effect will be included. Default is False.
    custom_raman : tuple[float, float, float] | str
        for tuple[float, float, float]:
            when there is a need of custom raman values in form of [fR, tau_1, tau_2]
            fR -> Raman coefficient.
            tau_1 and tau_2 are in picoseconds.
        for str:
            Can use strings like "dudley" to populate custom_raman value as per Dudley.
    shock : boolean
        Determines if the self-steepening (shock) term will be taken into
        account. This is especially important for situations where the
        slowly varying envelope approximation starts to break down, which
        can occur for large bandwidths (short pulses).
    integrator : string
        Selects the integrator that will be passes to scipy.integrate.ode.
        options are 'lsoda' (default), 'vode', 'dopri5', 'dopri853'.
        'lsoda' is a good option, and seemed fastest in early tests.
        I think 'dopri5' and 'dopri853' are simpler Runge-Kutta methods,
        and they seem to take longer for the same result.
        'vode' didn't seem to produce good results with "method='adams'", but
        things werereasonable with "method='bdf'"
        For more information, see:
        docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.ode.html
    print_status : boolean
         This determines if the propagation status will be printed. Default
         is True.

        (t) arrays.

        ``'amplitude'`` - Native units for the NLSE, AT and AW are sqrt(W).
        Does NOT consider the rep-rate.

        ``'intensity'`` - Absolute value of amplitude squared. These units make
        some sense for AT, since they are J/sec, so integrating over the pulse
        works as expected. Units for AW are J*Hz, so be careful when
        integrating. Does NOT consider rep-rate.

        ``'mW/bin'`` - AW and AT are in mW per bin, so naive summing provides
        average power (in mW). Rep-rate taken into account.

        ``'mW/THz'`` - returns AW in units of mW/THz and AT in mW/ps. Rep-rate
        taken into account.

        ``'dBm/THz'`` - returns AW in units of mW/THz and AT in dBm/ps.
        Rep-rate taken into account.

        ``'mW/nm'`` - returns AW in units of mW/nm and AT in mW/ps. Rep-rate
        taken into account.

        ``'dBm/nm'`` - returns AW in units of dBm/nm and AT in dBm/ps. Rep-rate
        taken into account.

        In the above, dBm is 10*log10(mW).

        Note that, for the "per nm" situations, AW is still
        returned on a grid of even *frequencies*, so the uneven wavelength
        spacing should be taken into account when integrating. Use
        ``get_results_wavelength`` to re-interpolate to an evenly spaced

        parameters
        ----------
        flim : float or array of length 2
            This sets the xlimits of the frequency domain plot. If this is a
            single number, it defines the dB level at which the plot will be
            set (with a margin). If an array of two values, this manually sets
            the xlims.
        tlim : float or array of length 2
            Same as flim, but for the time domain.
        margin : float
            Fraction to pad the xlimits. Default is 0.2.
        wavelength : boolean
            Determines if the "frequency" domain will be displayed in Frequency
            (THz) or wavelength (nm).
        show : boolean
            determines if plt.show() will be called to show the plot
        units : string
            Units for the frequency-domain plots. For example, dBm/THz mW/THz.
            See the documentation for the ``data_type`` keyword argument for
            the ``get_results`` method for more information.
        rep_rate : float
             The repetition rate of the pule train in Hz. This is used to
             calculate the average powers when using units other than
             "intensity".

        This function runs several nlse simulations (given by num_trials), each
        time adding random noise to the pulse. By comparing the electric fields
        of the different pulses, an estimate of the coherence can be made.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pulse_in : pulse object

        num_trials : int
            this determines the number of trials to be run.

        random_seed : int
            this is the seed for the random noise generation. Default is None,
            which does not set a seed for the random number generator, which
            means that the numbers will be completely randomized.
            Setting the seed to a number (i.e., random_seed=0) will still
            generate random numbers for each trial, but the results from
            calculate_coherence will be completely repeatable.

        noise_type : str
            this specifies the method for including random noise onto the
            pulse. See :func:`pynlo.light.PulseBase.Pulse.add_noise` for the
            different methods.

            distance and the frequency. g12 gives a measure of the coherence of
            the pulse by comparing several different trials.

        results : list of results for each trial
            This is a list, where each item of the list contains (z_positions,
